**Moviespotting - The Idea**

The idea is to build a social network where in people would share which movie they are watching currently. Something on the lines of Goodreads for movies.

See these [screenshot](https://github.com/swapnilmishra/moviespotting/tree/master/Moviespotting-screenshots) for detail.

**How to run**

1. Make sure "nodejs" is installed, you can check this by running "node" command on terminal.
2. Make sure "npm" is installed, you can check this by running "npm" command on terminal.
3. Make sure "mongodb" is installed on your system and "mongod" binary file is in your path.
3. Goto root directory where "package.json" is located.
4. Run "npm install". This command will install all the required "nodejs" dependencies.
5. From the same folder run "node app". This will start the server.
6. Start "mongodb" database server by running "mongod"
7. From browser open "http://localhost:3000" and you should see the app running.
